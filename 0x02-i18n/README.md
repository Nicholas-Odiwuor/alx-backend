# 0x02. i18n

## 📌 Description

This project introduces the concept of **internationalization (i18n)** in back-end web development using **Flask**. You will learn how to create web applications that can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.

The implementation focuses on setting up a multilingual-friendly structure and using Flask’s built-in support for localization to serve content in different languages based on user preferences or request headers.
