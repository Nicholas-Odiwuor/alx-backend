# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores the fundamentals of building a **queuing system in Node.js** using **Redis** and **Kue**. You'll learn how to integrate Redis with Node.js, manage asynchronous tasks, and set up a basic ExpressJS server that handles job queues.

This project reinforces key backend development concepts such as queue management, caching, and real-time task processing using Redis and JavaScript ES6.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Run a **Redis server** locally
- Perform **basic Redis operations** via its CLI
- Use a **Redis client in Node.js**
- Store and retrieve **hash values** in Redis
- Handle **asynchronous operations** using Redis
- Use **Kue** as a job queueing system
- Build a basic **ExpressJS application** that interacts with Redis
- Extend the Express app to **interact with Redis queues** for job processing
